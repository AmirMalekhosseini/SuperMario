This is my project for AP 2023 .
I created SuperMario game with all features in three phases using Java Swing.
This game has an offline mode that is inspired from the original game.
User can connect to the server(SuperMarioServer) using a button and some online features like Chat,game lobby,online shop,online friends,... will be activated for the user.
In case user is online every user's important informations will be saved in an online database that I created using MySql.
